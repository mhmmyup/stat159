Welcome to my lab 9 directory. Here, you'll see the transformation of my Simple Linear Regression report from a .Rmd file to a .Rnw file - from markdown to latex! It doesn't look exactly the same, but this was a start to learning how to use both latex and inline code in R instead of markdown. Both have their own formatting traits, and there isn't one better way to format. But it's worthwhile, probably, to learn both! The .pdf's definitely look different between the two!
